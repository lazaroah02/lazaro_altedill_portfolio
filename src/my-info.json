        "title": "Hi 👋, Welcome to my portfolio",
        "content": "I specialize in building full-stack web applications with React and Django, but I’ve worked across many types of software: AI agents, workflows with n8n, web scraping, Python scripts, mobile applications with React Native, and more. I love building software products, I’m passionate about technology, and I enjoy understanding how things work behind the scenes. \n\n I consider myself a problem solver, capable of adapting to any environment because I focus on fundamentals, which allows me to switch easily between technology stacks. At a fundamental level, a REST API is the same whether it’s built with Django, Express, Laravel, or any other technology. \n\n I believe the most important skill for a developer is not memorizing syntax, but knowing how to search for a solution and apply it. \n\nWe have the responsibility to build the future with our code.
